**audb** manages your annotated media files.

Databases used in machine learning
should be easily exchangeable
and versioned for reproducibility.
**audb** allows both
as it stores all databases in a `common format`_
and manages different versions of a database.
Databases are stored in repositories
on local file systems
or Artifactory_ servers.

You can request resampling or remixing of audio content
and filter the downloaded data,
e.g. if you just want to download the test set.

Have a look at the installation_ and quickstart_ instructions.
